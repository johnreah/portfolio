<h2>Campus World</h2>

<p>As a project, <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/ftp/grid.pdf">Campus World</a> did not change the face of 
education in Britain. It was interesting for a number of other reasons though. The BT Campus World service 
provided a "walled garden" of over 20,000 pages of education information to help schools make the best use of their
Internet connections, and it provided secure access to that information by a patented system of cookie-based
authentication. BT registered a second patent for secure file transfer, which was intended to provide strongly
encrypted authentication and file transfer to the education community for the transfer of such sensitive 
information as examination results.</p>

<p>My role was to develop client-side software for both authentication and file transfer, and this was to run
on 16-bit Windows, 32-bit Windows and MacOS.</p>

<p>Although Java was starting to become popular and there was a small number of cross-platform GUI libraries, 
there was still no reliable and flexible means of producing applications for multiple target platforms from a
single code base. My challenge therefore was to factor out as much code as possible into modules that could be 
recompiled on multiple systems without modification (such as the encryption API and the main internal data 
structures of the application), and to implement the platform-specific sections (GUI, desktop integration, 
automated installers) separately for each target platform. I used Borland's ObjectWindows library for the 
Windows versions, as it continued to offer 16-bit support even though 32-bit had become the norm, and for 
the Mac I used the Metrowerks CodeWarrior C++ development environment with the absolutely superb 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPlant">PowerPlant</a> class library created by Greg Dow.</p>
