<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>
These pages are an on-line CV, but they contain more detailed information on some of my past projects for anyone who may be interested.
Being a CV it's naturally been tailored for people who are thinking of working with me, so if that sounds like you then 
these pages should let you know what you can expect. If not, you may still learn a bit about me and my background 
working with computers - please read on. 
Of course I have the traditional kind of CV too. Write to me at <a href="mailto:john.reah@johnreah.com">john.reah@johnreah.com</a>
if you'd like a copy.

I've spent a fair amount of my life reading other people's CVs or tinkering with my own in the hope of impressing
prospective employers, agents and clients, and while there is no substitute for the written word I think there's often
a place for pictures too, so these pages include something of a scrapbook of previous projects. Some of these may be
a trip down memory lane, but I've chosen them because it turns out that even in a field that's changing as rapidly
as software engineering, there really is nothing new under the sun. Languages, frameworks and toolsets come and go, 
but software design patterns are a lifetime thing.

The mugshot at the top right is a fair and accurate representation (or so I was told by the artist, who now works in the
Chief Architect's Office of BT, so it must be true) of the way I looked during the month I left the security of a
full-time job with a final-salary pension to embark on a freelance contract with a 24-hour notice period. 
Of course it was a little while ago - only 17 short years since Sunderland had won the FA Cup.
