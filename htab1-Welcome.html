<h1>test1554Welcome!</h1>

<p>
These pages are an on-line CV, but they contain more detailed information on
some of my past projects for anyone who may be interested. Being a CV it's
naturally been tailored for people who are thinking of working with me, so if
that sounds like you then these pages should let you know what you can expect.
If not, you may still learn a bit about me and my background working with 
computers - please read on. Of course I have the traditional kind of CV too.
Write to me at <a href="mailto:john.reah@johnreah.com">john.reah@johnreah.com</a>
if you'd like a copy.

I've spent a lot of time reading other people's CVs or editing my own in
the hope of impressing prospective employers, agents and clients, and while
there is no substitute for the written word I think there's often a place for
pictures too, so these pages include something of a scrapbook of previous
projects. Some of these may be a trip down memory lane, but I've chosen them
because it turns out that even in a field that's changing as rapidly as
software engineering, there really is nothing new under the sun. Languages,
frameworks and toolsets come and go, but software design patterns are a
lifetime thing.
