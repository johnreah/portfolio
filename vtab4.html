<h2>Websites</h2>

<p>There can be no-one in the software business who hasn't tinkered with creating websites from time to time. My
first effort was produced about fifteen years ago using nothing but a text editor, and it featured a gaudy textured 
background bitmap and had pictures of guitars. As I learned more, I wrote a CGI program (in C!) to read a table of
tenpin bowling scores from the team I worked in, and present those formatted in an HTML table.</p>

<p>I also dabbled with Microsoft FrontPage, and even produced a site for a real customer, but my interest tailed 
off for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I didn't have access to customers wanting to pay me to write websites</li>
    <li>The best web design tools were really costly, and I wasn't paid for writing websites</li>
    <li>The landscape was changing so fast that investment in learning became rapidly obsolete</li>
    <li>Browser incompatibilities meant that as soon as you deviated from the simplest layouts you were committing
    yourself to lots of laborious cross-browser testing</li>
    <li>My day job had drifted further and further away from software development</p>
</ul>

<p>This last point was the most telling, and I was well aware that as a manager I hadn't actually produced 
anything useful for a depressingly long time. I started becoming involved again when my day job required me to 
maintain an event management system written by a colleague in Ruby on Rails. This made me realise how much I 
was missing software development, and also highlighted how much languages and frameworks had come on while I
wasn't looking. The following year I was called on to deploy a corporate discussion forum system to 
serve tens of thousands of users. At this time I had a mixed offshore and onshore team to write code for me, but there
was very little code development at first as we were evaluating and deploying different solutions, mostly built
on PHP and MySQL. After some early success in deploying a solution and migrating content in from various
local systems that were deployed around the company, there was a change of policy and it was decided that only a
Java-based solution would do. The task then became one of selecting and deploying another forum system, and
migrating all the existing content across. This did require extensive coding, as we were migrating from a MySQL 
database to an Oracle database via the Java API of the target system, and building an authentication connector
that would link the forum product to the corporate directory system. I wrote a fair amount of Java code at this 
time, and the immersion in MySQL/PHP/Java/Tomcat/WebLogic had not only sparked my interest in websites once again,
but had also brought me back into software development.</p>

<h2>On the server side...</h2>

<h3>Tax Form Database</h3>
<p>I've been working with web technologies on the server side since writing my first CGI application in C,
but apart from a couple of brushes with Java/Tomcat (for the BT Forum) and Ruby and Rails (for the BT 
Hothouse event management system) I hadn't done it as a day job until I joined HTK in 2014. A while before
that, an ex-colleague who runs an ISP asked me to look at embedding a database app within the WordPress
site of one of his clients. I decided to implement this in Grails, which was an interesting integration
project.</p>

<h3>The Jokes Database</h3>
<p>Ever since the advent of email, people have been using it to send jokes. In the early 90s I started 
gathering these in mailboxes, never to be seen again. During the late 90s I was working in a team that used 
Microsoft products extensively, and so I moved the collection into an Access database that published its
content via an IIS service running on my desktop and some ASP pages written in VBScript. It stayed there 
until Ruby on Rails came along, as mentioned above, at which point I completely reimplemented the database
and application in Ruby and MySQL. This proved to be a really good learning environment, as it involves
realistic requirements for user authentication, and has a representative set of database relationships to
be modelled. When I switched my allegiance from Ruby and Rails to Groovy and Grails in 2010 the site was
rewritten once again, and it now lives in the Cloud on an Amazon EC2 instance 
<a href="http://jokeemporium.com/">here</a>. Unless you have an account (available on request) you should
only be able to access a fairly small selection of inoffensive material. Each joke you see will have been
rendered via an Ajax call to a RESTful webservice that returns its data in JSON format. There's also a
<a href="https://jokeemporium.com/jokes-grails/mobile">mobile version</a> if you prefer.</p>

<h2>..and the client side</h2>

<h3>Stuart Anderson Sculpture</h3>
<p>In 2010 I was asked by a local ISP to write a website for Suffolk-based sculptor Stuart Anderson. As might be
expected, the brief was strong on artistic guidance but less so on technical steer. The pages were to have a
minimalist appearance and consist mainly of an interactive gallery of sculpture photographs, so the site 
clearly needed to be data driven in some way; however there was no decision on what environment the site was 
to be hosted in, so I couldn't count on having any kind of server-side code or database access. I chose to 
write the site entirely in HTML and JavaScript, so that the gallery could be hosted on any webserver capable 
of serving static HTML files, and navigation around the gallery was handled by JS on the client.</p>

<h3>These pages!</h3>
<p>Having soaked up quite a lot of server-side knowledge over the previous couple of years, in 2011 I 
looked again at what was happening on the client side. There was a proliferation of platforms on which people
were consuming content, so the traditional platforms of Mac and PC were now being augmented by smartphones 
and tablets, and on the desktop there were numerous browsers to be considered, including IE, Firefox, Chrome,
Opera and Safari. On the plus side however, most of these now do a far better job of adhering to standards
than they once did, and even IE has become much less troublesome to work with since version 8.</p>

<p>Better still, there are many libraries available to liven up web pages, and these take much of the pain 
of cross-browser portability away from the web page author. This site makes use of a number of these: the
underlying cleverness is all in <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, while 
<a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/">JQueryTools</a> provides the tabs at the top of the page and
the sliding accordion on the "past projects" page, and <a href="http://nivo.dev7studios.com/">NivoSlider</a>
handles the pictures. They're hosted on AWS S3 and delivered by an AWS CloudFront distribution to manage the
SSL.</p>
