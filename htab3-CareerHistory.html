<br />

<div class="lefthead">July 2014 to March 2020</div>
<div class="righthead">Head of Software Development</div><br />
<div class="lefthead">(Permanent)</div>
<div class="righthead">HTK Limited</div><br />
<p>At HTK I led a team of 8 in-house developers and a varying number of offshore contractors
with responsibility for the development and support of HTK Horizon, a multi-tier web-based
loyalty platform. As well as day-to-day responsibility for managing staff and running our
delivery processes (daily scrums, task assignment, release reviews and so on) I led a
number of technical improvements including refactoring a monolithic legacy codebase into a
series of more loosely coupled services, and introducing an automated build/test/deployment
pipeline. The core technology was the Java stack, with additional tools including Spring,

<div class="lefthead">September 2004 to July 2014</div>
<div class="righthead">Principal Consultant & Hothouse Event Leader</div><br />
<div class="lefthead">(Permanent)</div>
<div class="righthead">BT</div><br />
<p>In September 2004 I moved into BT as a Principal Consultant in the OpenAccess division, 
a new venture under BT Retail involved in both document management and legislative compliance. 
My first role was to manage the design and deployment of an FoI case management solution for 
Perth & Kinross Council, using products and consultants from three different companies. I later 
worked as Design Authority for Essex County Council's Electronic Document & Record Management 
System project, and led the technical workstream on a project to improve the on-line service 
request system for Essex County Council. I then spent two years leading Hothouses, intensive 
3-day team competitions to develop prototype solutions that initiate 90-day work programmes. 
From 2007-9 I worked in the Office of the Chief Architect, where I have managed the delivery 
of the BT Forum system forums.intra.bt.com. I now work in the Wholesale Delivery Hub in BTID, 
with responsibility for non-functionals across Global Platforms including outage reduction, 
the Availability To Trade programme, and alignment with BT Operate.</p>
<br />

<div class="lefthead">April 2000 to August 2004</div>
<div class="righthead">Senior Software Specialist and Business Development Director</div><br />
<div class="lefthead">(Permanent)</div><div class="righthead">Internet Designers Limited, Cambridge</div><br />
<p>In April 2000 I joined Internet Designers Limited (then a majority-owned BT subsidiary,
later an independent limited company) as a Senior Software Specialist, where my first assignments 
included the design and development of PC and Macintosh software for accessing BT's Internet services, 
as well as some development work on BTopenworld's Vignette content management system. I also became 
an IDL technical mentor, and I have mentored over 20 IDL employees and contractors. In 2001 I took 
the opportunity of moving into a business development role, but continued to maintain my technical 
skills by developing intranet sites in ASP.NET and C# to support IDL's business operations, and in 
2003 I undertook a performance analysis of the www.dotmusic.com web site, a Microsoft-based platform 
built on a load-balanced configuration of Windows 2000 servers running IIS5.
I also worked for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on their Electronic Document & Record Management 
System (EDRMS) project, working both on Business Analysis and on the design and implementation of 
document templates to assist with the capture and validation of metadata.</p>
<br />

<div class="lefthead">July 1999 to March 2000</div>
<div class="righthead">Client Pack Team for Mass Market Internet Products</div><br />
<div class="lefthead">(Agency contract)</div>
<div class="righthead">BT Adastral Park</div><br />
<p>Development of client packs for distribution to customers of BT's Internet products such as BT Internet 
and BT Click, including virtual service providers and partners such as Tesco, Barclays, Bank of Scotland, 
Dell, Natwest, MSN and Yahoo. My role was to provide custom components for Microsoft's Internet Explorer 
Administration Kit and to overhaul and support BT's dial-up networking client application, adding 
international language support for release in several European countries. Windows development was in 
Microsoft Visual C++ 6 and Macintosh development was in Metrowerks C++ with the PowerPlant class library.</p>
<br />

<div class="lefthead">July 1999 to March 2000</div>
<div class="righthead">Employee Skills & Training Database</div><br />
<div class="lefthead">(Direct contract)</div>
<div class="righthead">Buffin Learning Limited</div><br />
<p>Buffin Learning are an established consultancy who provide personal development and training services 
to clients in industry. Although not involved in the software business, they identified a need for a 
specialist database system to implement some of their original ideas for recording employees' performance 
over time and using the results to balance team structures, measure the effectiveness of training investment 
etc. An initial development by another company had already failed, and I was charged with designing and 
implementing a multi-user client-server database system that would not only meet their specifications but 
would help to recover client relationships that had been damaged by their earlier problems. The target 
environment was SQL Server 7 (or the Microsoft Data Engine for small installations) with a Visual Basic 6 
front-end. The system is currently being deployed in British Bakeries, and there is strong interest from 
Whitbread Breweries, Thames Valley Police and a number of other organisations.</p>
<br />

<div class="lefthead">July 1997 to June 1999</div>

<div class="righthead">BT Laboratories, Martlesham Heath</div><br />
<ul>
<li>Database design, development and support for Intranet Complete, a managed Intranet service designed 
for small to medium sized enterprises. This development was carried out jointly with Microsoft and 
Digital, and the platform was a "farm" of Windows NT servers located at Telehouse in London. The 
database was SQL Server 6.5 and the development language was Transact-SQL. I also developed data 
migration tools in  Access and Visual Basic with ADO (ActiveX Data Objects).</li>
<li>Design and development of an SMS (Short Message Service) gateway for GSM mobile phones 
and radio pagers for use in BT's Intranet Complete and Intranet Advantage services. This used 
a combination of SQL Server 6.5, T-SQL, Visual Basic, ADO, Internet Information Server and 
Active Server Pages.</li>
<li>Development of an automated batch loader and system administration script for BT's 
Uprush information service, delivered via the Internet and multimedia payphones. The development 
environment was Perl, Oracle and Solaris, using Vignette StoryServer for content management.</li>
<li>Enhancement of BT ClickFree dialler software for release to telcos in Germany, France, 
Belgium and Eire.</li>
</ul>

<div class="lefthead">(Direct contract)</div>
<div class="righthead">HTK Limited, Ipswich</div><br />
<p>HiTeKnowledge (HTK) are a small company specialising in speech technology. As well as hosting 
and managing interactive telephony services for a number of clients, they market their own speech 
platform and have agreements with BT for downstreaming recognition and synthesis technologies. 
As a showcase for the Laureate speech synthesiser I developed the Laureate Workshop application, 
which allows a user to experiment with the various facilities of the synthesiser and develop 
databases of announcements.</p>
<br />

<div class="lefthead">April 1996 to June 1997</div>
<div class="righthead">Internet Services Team</div><br />
<div class="lefthead">(Agency contract)</div>
<div class="righthead">BT Laboratories, Martlesham Heath</div><br />
<p>At this time BT had a rapidly growing involvement in Internet services, and I worked in a 
consultative and development capacity on:</p>
<ul>
<li>BT Internet, BT's public Internet service provision project, where my tasks were to evaluate 
Macintosh products for inclusion in the BT Internet client software package and to develop the 
installer package itself using MindVision VISE.</li>
<li>CampusWorld and CampusConnect, two of BT's educational Internet services, for which I wrote 
secure authentication and file transfer software for both Windows (Borland C++ & ObjectWindows) 
and Macintosh (Metrowerks C++ & PowerPlant). I also wrote a Java chess applet as a demonstration 
of how distributed Java processing can be used in Web pages.</li>
<li>Laureate, BT's text-to-speech system, to which I was seconded to assist with the user 
interface (Microsoft C++ with MFC) prior to a trial with London Underground. I was also involved 
with packaging the synthesiser as a plug-in module for Netscape Navigator, although this was never 
released.</li>

<p>This was my second contract with BT's Service Creation Tools team, developing the Visage suite 
of applications for the design and deployment of interactive speech services. This was the toolset 
used to develop the BT CallMinder service. My own tasks included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and development of a script language interpreter and debugger to run speech services 
under Windows. The front-end was written using C++ and Borland's ObjectWindows class library, 
although the major part of the development was the design and implementation of a cross-platform 
class library for use by various applications in the toolset running under Windows, Unix and DOS. 
This class library incorporated parsers written with YACC and Lex, and provided access to a library 
of "plug-and-play" building blocks using a component-based scheme similar to COM. The design used 
the Booch method and was carried out in collaboration with a consultant from Rational, the creators 
of the Booch method.</li>
<li>Design and development of an ObjectWindows application using the WinSock socket library to 
communicate with speech server processes running on Sun workstations.</li>
<liDesign and development of an application to translate speech service source code from BT's 
internal script language into Tcl.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Service Creation Tools team at BT Labs is responsible for a suite of programs that assist in 
the automatic generation of speech-interactive services. Their toolset includes a graphical dialogue 
design tool written in Visual Basic which generates a textual definition of a service; this service 
may be simulated using an interpreter or passed to a C++ code translator which generates C++ application 
code for one of a number of target platforms. My responsibilities included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Porting an MS-DOS C library for a PC audio/telephony card (the BT Speechcard) to the Windows 
environment as a multi-tasking dynamic-link library that could be called from a variety of languages. 
This included writing a user manual and sample applications in Visual Basic, C and C++ using the Borland 
ObjectWindows class library.</li>
<li>Providing Windows API support to the team of permanent staff.</li>
