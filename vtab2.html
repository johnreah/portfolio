<h2>Apple Computer Europe</h2>

<p>Having built up solid set of skills in C software development over a five year period, I was disappointed to find that 
being good at one's job was not a passport to career progression (and more importantly increased remuneration)
in the company that employed me at the time. I approached an ex-colleague who was working at Apple's European headquarters 
in Paris, who got me an interview for a contract working at Apple Computer Europe. The interview was with Apple's management
consultancy Peat Marwick McLintock (now KPMG) and was straightforward enough, and after working my notice (during which 
time I was summoned by my boss's boss's boss's boss and belatedly offered a promotion to stay) I took a plane to Paris 
and pitched up on Monday morning at La D&eacute;fense.
</p>

<p>So far so good. But what I did not know was that I had been lined up for a job on Apple's European production forecasting 
database, a system that took sales forecasts from each of twenty European capital cities and turned those into production
schedules for their manufacturing plants. My greeting on that first morning at Apple from one of KPMG's senior consultants 
was "Good morning John, how's your SQL?" I knew almost nothing about SQL, but I must have given a suitably convincing reply
because I survived the two week trial period, during which I was on a 24-hour notice period, and went on to work for a further 
9 months on that contract, eventually becoming the last of a large team of contractors on the project to have their contract 
terminated. The learning curve was steep though, and I burned a lot of midnight oil sitting in my hotel room studying
relational databases and how best to embed SQL within C. After Apple and KPMG wound down their relationship at the end of 
the ADB project, I was the only contractor to be approached directly by Apple to rejoin the project, this time working 
directly for Apple, and I remained there for most of the following year.</p>

<h3>So what was it like to work for Apple?</h3>

<p>Outstanding! My two years at Apple were during the tenure of John Sculley, i.e. after the departure of Steve Jobs and 
before his return in 1996. During this period many of the Macs to be seen on people's desks bore a stronger resemblance
to IBM PCs than they did to the single-box original Macs or the translucent iMacs that were to come. Nonetheless a 
sense of fun permeated the workplace, and the work ethic was strong too. In and around the offices there were pinball tables,
table tennis, pool, free drinks and so on. Every Friday a catering firm brought in a vast spread to which all staff and 
contractors were invited for a bit of socialising and networking. However when the financial close period arrived each 
month you would find people starting early and working late, to ensure that business needs were met. In short, people
were motivated and it was a good place to be. This kind of environment is offered by all manner of software companies
nowadays, but in 1990 it was quite an innovation.</p>

<p>At the end of my second stint at Apple, I had the opportunity of going to the States to continue working for
Apple. My decision to come back to the UK instead rates highly among my "top 5 career cock-ups".

<h3>And why was this all important?</h3>

<p>This was an important period for me for several reasons, as I think it would have been for anyone working abroad for the 
first time while simultaneously being thrown in at the deep end on a high pressure project that was technically unfamiliar.</p>

<p>From a personal point of view it was a stressful but extremely liberating experience, as I made the transition from being a 
skilled but relatively anonymous employee of a large organisation to a one man band, entirely responsible for my own
success or failure.</p>

<p>From a technical point of view it represented a huge learning opportunity, and I left Apple two years later as a seasoned
database engineer, with skills in relational database design, application programming using embedded C/SQL, performance
engineering learnt on clustered hardware processing tables containing many millions of rows (still quite a big deal in 1990)
and database administration. As well as the back-office database work I took every opportunity to work at the desktop level
too, producing user documentation using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a>'s fantastic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">Hypercard</a>, one of the most successful hypermedia systems before the
advent of the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>Finally, from a commercial point of view, it gave me experience of working in a large commercial software team. The
KPMG team at Apple comprised about two dozen KPMG employees and a similar number of contractors. The project was managed using
SSADM, and there was a well-structured approach to specification, development, functional testing, performance testing,
deployment and in-life support. I can't say it gave me a huge appetite for working in large teams in future, but it was
a useful experience just the same.</p>
