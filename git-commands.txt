Some git commands

To stage and commit modified files (not new ones):
git commit -a

To push to remote origin (as long as you're already on the master branch:
git push origin

To list tags:
git tag

To make an annotated tag:
git tag -a v2020-01-25 -m "Update some stuff"

To push tags (because push doesn't do this by default):
git push origin --tags


AWS CLI commands to publish from staging folder to live folder:
# aws s3 sync s3://johnreah.info-dev s3://johnreah.info
# aws s3 sync s3://johnreah.info-dev s3://johnreah.info --cache-control max-age=3600,s-maxage=3600

AWS CLI commands to publish from staging folder to live folder and override
cacheing metadata. The s3 sync command supports cache-control and metadata
replacement, but it seems only to work when a file is actually copied. If
a file is not synced then its metadata is not changed.
aws s3 rm s3://johnreah.info --recursive
aws s3 cp s3://johnreah.info-dev s3://johnreah.info --recursive --cache-control max-age=3600,s-maxage=3600
