<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Things I've tried (and am still trying)</h2>

<p>
I grew up in a household full of music, so I've always loved it. I'm especially fond of jazz and the guitar.
I don't have any formal musical training, but I've played guitar in my own amateurish way since I was a teenager.
</p>

<p>
I'm also fond of motor cycles. I started riding when I was 17, but although I've had bikes almost all the 
time since, they've generally spent far too long in the garage. In 2009 I joined the Institute of Advanced Motorists and took their 
advanced test, then joined one of their organised trips to France. This was a great experience, and
spending time on the road with more experienced riders including police instructors is a terrific way of gaining 
both ability and confidence.

I've recently become interested in sailing and have gained some RYA certifications in yachts and powerboats,
so if you have a boat and are in need of crew please get in touch!

Computers have fascinated me since the late 1970s. Unlike many people who came to computers through the
ZX-80, ZX-81, TRS-80 and BBC Micro I was interested more in electronics than computing and saw those machines more
for what they could do in controlling other systems than what they could do for information processing and of 
course entertainment. I learnt computer languages from the bottom up, starting with assembly language and later C. 
My Damascus moment was my first experience of using an Apple Macintosh, and grasping the notion that computers could 
be made easy to use by anyone. The ease-of-use mantra was fascinating to me, and most of my work for the next ten
years was freelance work driven by this interest in personal/desktop computing and user interfaces on both PCs 
and Macs.

By the year 2000 I had a young family and my priorities had moved towards job security, and I moved back into 
permanent employment. However this was accompanied by a shift away from hands-on technical work and more 
into management, business development and mentoring. At the same time the industry focus was moving away from 
client-side development to web-based server-side applications, and my software development skills 
were becoming slightly stale. In about 2009 I decided to do something about this and started to 
recover the lost ground, gaining certifications in Java and Oracle and developing applications with more
modern dynamic languages and frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and Grails. In 2014 I joined HTK, which offered
me the opportunity to become hands-on again, and I've recently been concentrating on gaining some
certifications in the AWS cloud technology we use for <a href="https://www.htk.co.uk/">HTK Horizon</a>.

I'm also supposed to be spending my spare time exercising, but although I'm a regular dog walker my attendance at 
the gym and the pool seem to be rapidly descending into the category of...

<h2>Things I've done and no longer do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Playing the guitar in front of people - I've played in several bands and once in a duo, but not for a few years.</li>
<li>Hang-gliding - I learned this at York University, and flew for the university team at the 1985 inter-university 
competition in South Wales. I stopped after moving to Suffolk as it's a bit short of hills, and I had no car or 
available funds at the time. From time to time I've thought of resuming this, and tried out parascending and 
free-fall parachuting as well, but I think this particular itch is now being scratched by motorcycling instead.</li>
<li>Charity work - I spent 5 years as a volunteer and committee member for the East Suffolk branch of a national charity.</li>
<li>Cricket - I've loved cricket since I was at school, and more recently played a few seasons for a local village team.</li>
</ul>
