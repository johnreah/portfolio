<h2>BT Click</h2>

<p>At the end of the 1990s broadband penetration was still very low, and most of the UK still accessed the Internet
using dial-up means with the princely bandwidth of 28.8 kilobits per second (or even 56kbits/s if they were really lucky).
Not every customer entered into a contract for their Internet service, and there was a market for Pay-As-You-Go
connections that were charged for by the tariff of the number used to connect. BT provided a white-label dial up 
service that enabled companies easily to become "Virtual ISPs" by using a custom phone number and driving traffic
to that number by whatever means they chose. I was part of BT's Client Pack Team, and we had responsibility for 
providing a variety of mass-market software distributions carrying different VISPs' branding, offering easy Internet
access for these VISPs' customers. BT's customers and partners included NatWest, Yahoo, Bank of Scotland, Carphone 
Warehouse, Dell, Microsoft MSN and numerous others.

<p>I was the lead software developer in this team, and most of my time was spent on the Dialler application. In
many ways this was a hugely frustrating experience, because at this time there was still a large installed base
of original Windows 95 machines, and although there were relatively frequent updates to Microsoft's OS at the time,
the Dial-Up Networking components of the OS were among the components with the biggest churn, and we had to support
them all. In the first release of Windows 95, the only way to modify dial-up networkin gsettings was by direct
access to the Windows registry. In subsequent versions the DUN API was introduced, but the implementation was
at varying levels of completeness with each version. To support these different releases we produced our
own dial-up networking interface, so we could maintain a consistent application code base while introducing 
new networking implementations as new OS variants like Win 95 OSR2, Windows 98 and Windows Millennium Edition 
arrived on the scene. We also had to maintain a dedicated test suite, so that we could prove operation with a 
representative set of client hardware running a range of different OS versions. Norton Ghost was crucial!</p>

<p>Coping with changes to the DUN API was only part of the challenge. Various aspects of the user interface required
custom branding to identify the VISP we were working with. To manage the multiple identities of each build of our 
software, we defined a standard set of brand assets to be provided by the VISP, and developed a custom build process
with a configuration parameter that allowed all the brand assets to be imported and the software built
automatically witha single command.</p>

<p>The build configuration did not stop there: we also had multipe languages to contend with. The method for 
maintaining localised string resources in Windows applications is well understood, so the challenge for us was to
work with translators to produce suitable text resources and incoprorate the languages into our automated build
process. We shipped variants of the BT Click product in English, French and Danish.</p>

<h4>And why was this important?</h4>

<p>Despite the frustration of adapting code to work with multiple Microsoft Operating Systems, which seemed to 
require a significant amount of effort from us every six months or so, there was a buzz in shipping
software that was available to upwards of a million users.</p>

<p>It was also an object lesson in the importance of automating as many aspects of the software lifecycle as possible.
In modern development environments it is common to make heavy use of build tools like Maven and Ant, testing frameworks 
like JUnit/NUnit and Cobertura, and CIT tools like Hudson/Jenkins and CruiseControl. We worked by the same principles, 
but, with the exception of "make", we had to build the toolbox ourselves.</p>
