<h3>About the BT Speechcard</h3>

<p>This was my first "commercial strength" project, and it dates back to the late 1980s and the very early
days of interactive telephone services.</p>

<p>At this time, general purpose computers still didn't have the necessary horsepower to carry out real-time
signal processing tasks, and the market was finding a growing number of applications for dedicated digital signal processing chips such as the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS320">Texas Instruments TMS320</a>. One such product was the VOTAN V5000 speech system, 
which was an IDE-format circuit board that plugged into an IBM PC-XT to enable it to carry out recording, playback and template-based
isolated-word speech recognition. BT obviously had a huge potential market for interactive speech applications, and it ran a number of human factors 
trials of "smart" answering machines, as well as an interactive voice-operated game called "The Train Game", which was a first-person adventure game 
based on chasing and apprehending a murderer on the London Underground. My boss at the time wrote the application (in IBM BASIC!) and I helped manage the system
and analyse the results. This also entailed spending a day in a recording studio with Joe Grundy from The Archers, who provided the voice. The Guardian 
ran a technology feature on the trial, and our paltry 4-line installation was inundated with calls day and night for the week that the trial was live.</p>

<p>As well as a huge market however, BT also had a great deal of in-house expertise
in speech processing, and didn't want to be dependent on third-party suppliers when it could do the job itself. BT set to work to produce 
its own "Speechcard", which was a densely-populated PC format card carrying a Motorola control processor, <i>two</i> 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_56000">Motorola DSP56000</a>s, a
custom VLSI chip carrying a "Dynamic Time Warp Engine", and a daughter board with telephone interface circuit compliant with UK
connection regulations. The speech processing capability of the card was world-leading for the time, and represented 
the work of a great many people, but my involvement was in turning it into a development platform on which BT could build further trials and 
applications showcasing its own hardware and algorithms. The card was designed by one engineer, and the control firmware by another; my task was to 
develop code on the PC side, and this comprised a library of about 50 functions implemented in C that provided application programs with all the 
control and data management functions necessary to exploit all the capabilities of the card. This meant that applications could carry out recording 
and replay of audio using a variety of coding methods; they could perform speaker-dependent and speaker-independent isolated word recognition; they
could combine DTMF touch-tone interactions along with speech, and they could control analogue phone lines.</p>

<p>The project didn't stop with just coding the library: the Speechcard was rolled out to various parts of BT as a platform for developing
speech services, and as well as maintenance and onward development of the library I was responsible for documentation including the user manual,
sample programs, user education and consultancy. An interesting part of this challenge was to engineer multi-tasking solutions on the
essentially single-tasking operating systems on PCs at the time, namely MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. This was a fascinating activity and
it led me towards a deep knowledge of the internals of those systems, and solid experience of writing applications in a collaborative
multi-tasking environment that stood me in good stead as a contractor throughout the 1990s.</p>

<h3>Speech Applications and Service Creation Tools</h3>

<p>Because the Speechcard was equipped with only a single-line analogue interface, it was a terrific tool for PC-based prototyping but it was
not well suited to large-scale exchange-based solutions. Nonetheless a rack containing 32 channels of discrete single-card PCs linked by 
a Novell Netware network was constructed and used for trials
including the Royal Bank of Scotland's "PhoneLine" service, which was the first speech-interactive telephone service in the UK. I invented
a mechanism for modelling nodal dialogue structures in C language, and developed a number of support and data analysis tools in C++ using the
object-oriented libraries Turbo Vision (a breathtakingly performant and easy to use character-based windowing interface for DOS
applications) and ObjectWindows (Borland's superior counterpart to Microsoft's MFC). The Speechcard was also used in the development
of CallMinder, BT's "answering machine in the network". By this time, the development of speech systems in BT was moving to Solaris, and
although I was involved early on in developing C++ classes for implementing interactive dialogues, my interests lay much more with how 
users interacted with the desktop, and I moved away from the speech area.</p>

<h3>So why is this interesting?</h3>

<p>
This was an important time for me, because it marked my transition from an academic and trialling background to one where people were
actually using my code in significant numbers. Library code in particular needed to be robust, with thorough error checking and recovery,
well defined and consistent behaviour with no memory leaks, meaningful error codes and comprehensive documentation. If any of these areas
fell short, there were plenty of programmers and managers who knew my phone number.</p>

<p>In other words, I learned how to do quality.</P>
